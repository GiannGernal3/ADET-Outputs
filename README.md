## 📅 Weekly Outputs

| Week | Title                                        | Description                                                                                      |
|------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Group Formation                              | Initial team setup and planning phase.                                                           |
| 2    | IoT Data Simulation - Logistics              | Simulated logistics parcel data with random origins, destinations, and timestamps.              |
| 3    | Smart Contract                               | Developed a Solidity smart contract to store logistics data on the blockchain.                  |
| 4–5  | Milestone 1 - Smart Tracking System          | Deployed smart contract to External HTTP Provider (Ganache) testnet and stored data using Web3.py and Jupyter Notebook. |
| 6    | Data Retrieval and Processing                | Retrieved data from blockchain, converted timestamps, and cleaned data.                         |
| 7    | Visualizations & RFID Verification           | Plotted parcel travel duration, RFID tag verification status, and added trend lines.            |
